**CMSC422: Machine Learning**

!!! Tip
    This is a live site for the ongoing Fall 2018 class

Welcome to CMSC422: Machine Learning! 

It's an exciting time to study machine learning! This course is a broad overview of methods for machine learning and an introduction to adaptive systems. We will cover: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, learning theory, deep learning, and reinforcement learning.

## Course Materials
- Maryland students: [Piazza](http://piazza.com/umd/fall2018/cmsc422)
- [A Course in Machine Learning, Hal Daum√© III](http://ciml.info/)

# Logistics
## Prerequisites
Students are expected to have the following background::
- CMSC320: Introduction to Data Science
- MATH240 or MATH461: Introduction to Linear Algebra
- CMSC330: Organization of Programming Languages
- CMSC351: Introduction to algorithms

## Grading
There will be *five* assignments, *two* midterms, and *one* final.

## Assignments 
Assignments must be submitted through the class [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com). Use the code 9ZZKKR to sign up for the course. 

## No Late Assignments
The instructors and the teaching assistants reserve the right to not accept late homework. Homework problems may be reviewed in the class in which they are due, rendering late homework unacceptable as the answers are then given.

## Honor Code
We encourage students to form study groups, but each student must independently work on their own solutions without referencing information from another student or outside source.
