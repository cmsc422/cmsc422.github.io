**CMSC422: Machine Learning**

!!! Tip
    This is a live site for the ongoing Fall 2018 class

Welcome to CMSC422: Machine Learning! 

This course broadly covers  an introduction to machine learning and pattern recognition. Topics include: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, learning theory, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. This course will also cover applications of machine learning, including computer vision, natural language processing, bioinformatics, and autonomous navigation.

Machine Learning (ML) studies representations and algorithms that allow machines to improve their performance on a task from experience. This course provides a broad overview of existing methods for machine learning and an introduction to adaptive systems in general. Emphasis is given to practical aspects of machine learning and data mining.

Machine learning is all about finding patterns in data to get computers to solve problems. Instead of explicitly programming computers to perform a task, machine learning lets us program the computer to learn from examples and improve over time without human intervention. This requires we address several difficult questions, including how to generalize beyond the examples that have been provided at "training time" to new examples that you see at "test time". 

It's an exciting time to study machine learning! This course is a broad overview of existing methods for machine learning and an introduction to adaptive systems in general. Emphasis is given to practical aspects of machine learning, connectionist approaches and reinforcement learning. The techniques we will cover are broadly applicable, and have led to significant advances in many fields, including stock trading, game playing, robotics, machine translation, computer vision, medicine
and many more.

## Grading
There will be *five* assignments, *two* midterms, and *one* final.

## Assignment Submission
Assignments will be submitted through [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com). Use the code XXXXX to sign up for the course.

## No Late Assignments
The instructors and the teaching assistants reserve the right to not accept late homework. Homework problems may be reviewed in the class in which they are due, rendering late homework unacceptable as the answers are then given.

## Honor Code
We encourage students to form study groups, but each student must independently work on their own solutions without referencing information from another student or outside source.
