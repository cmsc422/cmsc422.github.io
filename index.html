## Grading
There will be *five* assignments, *two* midterms, and *one* final.

## Assignment Details
Assignments will be submitted through [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com). Use the code 9ZZKKR to sign up for the course. See the [Assignment Page](https://cmsc422.github.io/assignments.html) for details on how to submit your assignments.

## No Late Assignments
The instructors and the teaching assistants reserve the right to not accept late homework. Homework problems may be reviewed in the class in which they are due, rendering late homework unacceptable as the answers are then given.

## Honor Code
We encourage students to form study groups, but each student must independently work on their own solutions without referencing information from another student or outside source.
