**Due Date:** Monday, Dec 10

## Getting Started
Clone the Project 3 repo from [Github](https://github.com/cmsc422/project3-linear-to-nonlinear).

Follow the instructions provided in the README.

## Submission

Create a compressed archive file (zip, tar, etc) containing your code, and upload to the Project 3 (Code submission) assignment on the ELMS course page. Your archive should contain all code, not just the files you edited.

Export your completed project notebook as a PDF.
